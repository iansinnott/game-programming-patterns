# Game Programming Patterns - Exercises

This is my repo for any code relating to my reading of the excellent [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).

My intent here was to use plain JS (maybe I will add some static typing... but otherwise plain) to practice some of the concepts in the book. Why JS? Simply because it's my most comfortable language, but it would be fun to go over these in other languages too, especially one's i'm trying to learn.
